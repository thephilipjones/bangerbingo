# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 5-1-song-scheduling-and-host-playback-controls (2026-04-04)

- `/next` silently unpauses a paused round — spec (AC3) has no guard; calling `/next` while paused advances and clears `paused` as a side effect. May need explicit guard in a later story.
- Round stays `active: true` after `songs:exhausted` — spec doesn't require deactivation; post-exhaustion `/play` returns 400 "already playing" which is misleading but acceptable for MVP.
- Stale fired timer IDs retained in `round.timers` after expiry — `clearTimeout` on a fired timer is a no-op; harmless for MVP but `round.timers.autoAdvance !== undefined` cannot be used as a "timer pending" predicate by future code.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-1-pkce-oauth-and-session (2026-04-03)

- SESSION_SECRET is required/validated at startup but never used to sign the session cookie. Spec says "wire up now, use later" — wire actual signing when needed.
- requireAuth middleware does not check token_expires_at. Expired access tokens remain valid until re-login. Story 1.2 handles refresh.
- access_token and refresh_token stored as plaintext in SQLite. Acceptable for friends-use MVP; consider encryption at rest for any broader deployment.
- No AbortController timeout on fetch() calls to Spotify token endpoint and /v1/me. A hung Spotify response will hang the callback handler indefinitely.
- refresh_token presence in Spotify token response is assumed but not guarded. PKCE auth code flow reliably returns it per Spotify docs, but no runtime guard exists.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-2-token-refresh-and-degraded (2026-04-03)

- Concurrent scheduler ticks can refresh the same host simultaneously — no per-host in-progress guard; two overlapping ticks can write conflicting tokens. Fix: add an in-progress Set checked before calling `refreshWithRetry`.
- `startRefreshScheduler()` runs unconditionally in test environment — unlike `serve()`, not guarded by `nodeEnv !== 'test'`; leaks a live interval across test files.
- Empty `refresh_token` in DB causes 4 unnecessary Spotify retries — application layer has no guard; schema NOT NULL covers normal flow.
- `/api/auth/status` `tokenExpiresAt` is stale — snapshot from `requireAuth` middleware; `degraded` is live but `tokenExpiresAt` lags one cycle when scheduler refreshes concurrently.
- Startup fan-out — after long downtime all expired hosts trigger simultaneously on first tick; low risk for ≤5 users.
- `authEvents` has no `'error'` listener — latent crash if any caller emits `'error'` without a registered handler.
- `retryWithBackoff` retries non-recoverable 4xx errors identically to 5xx — wastes up to 4 attempts on revoked tokens.
- `getAllHosts()` uses `SELECT *` — column projection would limit token exposure in memory.
- No jitter in backoff — multiple simultaneous expirations hammer Spotify in lockstep; low risk at ≤5 users.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-1-room-creation-api-and-code-generation (2026-04-03)

- No rate limiting or per-host room cap on POST /api/rooms — a single authenticated host can hammer the endpoint or exhaust the 24^5 code space over time. Harden in a future epic.
- Session cookie is raw `user_id` with no signature/MAC — trivially forgeable by anyone who knows a valid Spotify user ID. Pre-existing auth design; address when hardening auth.
- Prepared statements re-created on every DB call — `better-sqlite3` recommends caching. Pre-existing pattern in `db.ts`; optimize if performance becomes a concern.
- `SELECT *` in `getRoomsByHost`/`getRoomByCode` — future schema additions will silently appear in API responses. Low risk now; explicit projection preferred at hardening time.
- Test alphabet regex does not pin exact 24-char set — `/^[A-Z]+$/` and `/[OI]/` pass even with a wrong alphabet. Tighten in a future test-quality pass.
- `initDb` does not call `db.close()` before reassigning the module-level handle — silent connection leak on double-init. Pre-existing pattern; fix when adding graceful shutdown.
- POST /api/rooms returns HTTP 200 instead of 201 — REST convention deviation; spec does not mandate 201. Align if the API is ever consumed by strict REST clients.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-1-web-playback-sdk-spike (2026-04-03)

- `player.connect()` promise rejection unhandled — throwaway spike code; wire rejection handling in Epic 5's real `SpotifySDKProvider`.
- `player.pause()` rejection unhandled in auto-stop (`clipTimer` callback) and manual pause handler — throwaway spike code; handle in Epic 5.
- `initTime` measurement conflation — `btn-connect` handler overwrites `initTime` set in `initPlayer`; log label is accurate but comment implies it covers construction time too. Clarify in Epic 5 if latency budgeting matters.
- `seek()` during active playback not validated — spike uses `position_ms` on `/play` instead; `player.seek()` mid-clip behaviour unknown. Validate in Epic 5's `SpotifySDKProvider`.
- `state_changed` fires ~8–9 times in rapid burst at position 60000ms when playback starts at a seek position. Epic 5 game loop should debounce or skip events until position advances past the seek point before trusting state.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-2-websocket-room-session-and-player-presence (2026-04-03)

- Session cookie value used as literal user ID — no HMAC signing; pre-existing auth pattern from Story 3-1, acceptable for MVP.
- `getHostRoom` O(n) linear scan over all rooms on every `auth:degraded` event — not a correctness concern at friends-use scale.
- `roomSockets` entries never pruned — in-memory room state grows without bound across server lifetime; rooms should be evicted when host disconnects and all guests have left.
- `auth:degraded` event listener registered at module load and never removed — acceptable for production singleton, latent issue if module is ever re-evaluated.
- `parseCookies` does not handle RFC 6265 quoted cookie values — session cookie writer does not produce quoted values in practice.
- `getPlayerList` may theoretically include sockets in `CLOSING` state between disconnect and close-event cleanup — near-instant transition, single-threaded JS, no real exposure.
- No maximum guest count enforced — unlimited guests can join a room; out of scope for personal MVP.
- `setupWebSocketServer` called twice on the same `httpServer` would double-handle upgrades — not a real production scenario, but no guard exists.
- `roomSockets.hostUserId` populated from `room.host_user_id` which could be null if DB schema permits — pre-existing schema concern; null would permanently break `auth:degraded` delivery for that room.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-4-login-and-lobby-screens (2026-04-03)

- Authenticated host navigating to `/room/CODE` lands on dashboard — pre-existing design decision (same behavior as before this story); intent of deep-linked room URL is silently discarded for authenticated users.
- Create Room button not disabled while room list is still loading — minor concurrent UX gap; no spec requirement to gate it.
- `applyPlayerEvent` does not deduplicate player names — inflated player count if server sends duplicate `player:joined`; server already prevents duplicate names at connection time.
- `player:joined` before `session:connect` ordering race — client overwrites any optimistic state with `session:connect` snapshot; server sends `session:connect` synchronously on connect, making this a near-impossible race in practice.

## Deferred from: code review of 3-5-host-disconnect-and-reconnect (2026-04-03)

- Flaky 200ms wall-clock timing assertion in host disconnect test (`ws.test.ts`) — `Date.now()` delta will fail non-deterministically under load or constrained CI; replace with a structural assertion or mock timers.
- Silent error swallowing in `RoomPage.onMount` `onError` handler — if server closes the guest WS (4004, 4009, etc.), the guest sees no UI feedback; revisit when double-WebSocket lifecycle is corrected.
- `closeCodeToMessage` in `ws.ts` has no entries for close codes 4000 ("missing name") and 4001 ("unauthorized") — pre-existing gap; guest receives generic "Connection failed" message for these codes.

## Deferred from: code review of 4-1-track-pool-api (2026-04-04)

- `playlistId` path param not sanitized before URL interpolation — authenticated host can reach arbitrary Spotify API paths through the server's token (src/server/music/router.ts:44).
- Concurrent token refresh race: two simultaneous requests both see expiring token and call `refreshWithRetry` in parallel — low risk at ≤5 users but wastes Spotify quota (src/server/music/router.ts:21-28).
- Inline token refresh block duplicated verbatim in `/music/search` and `/music/tracks/:playlistId` handlers — future fix must be applied twice (src/server/music/router.ts).
- `token_expires_at` ms/seconds unit not enforced at DB schema level — if written in seconds, every request would attempt an inline refresh (src/server/music/router.ts:24).

## Deferred from: code review of 4-2-round-configuration-screen (2026-04-04)

- `pendingRound` silently dropped + `roundNumber` non-durable when `roomSockets` has no entry — if host hasn't opened a WS connection yet, round config is returned (HTTP 200) but never stored; counter resets on server restart. Explicitly acceptable for this story per dev notes; Story 4-3 will consume `pendingRound`. (src/server/rooms.ts)
- `onRoundStarted()` fires before any WebSocket broadcast to guests — host navigates to lobby while guests receive no signal. By design as placeholder per AC8; Epic 5 will add the WS round-start broadcast. (src/client/pages/RoundConfigPage.svelte + src/server/rooms.ts)
- API response for presets/search not shape-validated before rendering — non-array response would crash `{#each}` at runtime. Low risk for server-controlled endpoints; acceptable for MVP scope. (src/client/pages/RoundConfigPage.svelte)

## Deferred from: code review of 4-3-card-generation-and-round-start (2026-04-04)

- `sessionPlayedIds` grows with duplicate entries across rounds — functionally harmless (Set in buildPool deduplicates), but array balloons; deduplicate on append if it ever matters at scale. (src/server/rooms.ts)
- State mutation + WS broadcast precede `recordPlayedSongs` — if SQLite throws after cards are sent, DB misses the round's tracks and next round won't down-rank them. Move persist before broadcast if atomicity is ever required. (src/server/rooms.ts)
- Concurrent `POST /round` requests can race on `roomState.currentRound` — two simultaneous calls both compute `roundNumber = 1`, both broadcast, last write wins for in-memory state. No real risk for single-host personal app; add in-flight guard if multi-concurrent start is ever possible. (src/server/rooms.ts)
- Token expiry NaN guard — if `token_expires_at` is 0/null/undefined, subtraction yields NaN and refresh is skipped silently. Pre-existing pattern from music/router.ts; audit all inline refresh blocks when hardening auth. (src/server/rooms.ts)
- `played_songs` has no FK reference to `rooms(code)` — orphaned rows accumulate on room deletion; room code reuse (331,776 combinations) could produce false down-ranking. Add FK or periodic cleanup when adding room lifecycle management. (src/server/db.ts)
- `generateCards` uniqueness test is non-deterministic — `Math.random()` not seeded; rare CI flake theoretically possible. Seed with a fixed value or use a deterministic pool in this test. (src/server/__tests__/cards.test.ts)
- `roundNumber` pendingRound fallback — falls back to `pendingRound.roundNumber + 1` when `currentRound` is absent; stale `pendingRound` could produce wrong round number in edge cases. Currently harmless since `pendingRound` is set each round. (src/server/rooms.ts)
- Host reconnecting mid-round receives no `round:start` re-send — host client must independently reconcile state. Out of scope for this story; consider adding equivalent of late-join logic to host reconnect path in Epic 5 or hardening epic. (src/server/ws.ts)
- Late-join guest gets blank card for round 1; if round 2 starts, a new real card is generated but round 1 blank is never backfilled. Acceptable per current design; revisit when multi-round UX is built in Epic 5. (src/server/ws.ts)

## Deferred from: code review of 3-3-guest-join-screen (2026-04-03)

- Host login path (`page = 'login'`) now unreachable — by design for this sprint; story 3-4 will restore host login routing once the login+lobby screens are built.
- `data.role` unguarded in `session:connect` message parse — benign today since `handleJoined` discards `role`; becomes a silent contract violation when room view is built.
- `roomSockets` server-side accumulation — pre-existing issue logged in story 3-2 deferred work; rooms are never evicted when vacated.
- `handleJoined` in `App.svelte` discards `role` and `players` from the WS handshake — intentional stub; RoomPage will need both when the game loop is built in Epic 5.
